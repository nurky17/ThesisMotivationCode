# ThesisMotivationCode

The code "Motivation" was used for fitting NIG, VG and normal distributions (can be used for a lot of others too) to the data in the Master Thesis.

The "fitter" is the edited version of https://pypi.org/project/fitter/, as the original package has no VG distribution available, 
we added it to the package ourselves.

The VG functions were added from the VarGamma code found at https://github.com/dlaptev/VarGamma/blob/master/VarGamma.py, but since we also had to
edit a little that code, we added the edited version as well.
